# cs50g

In this repository you can find my answers to the CS50 Intro to Game Development course assignments offered by HarvardX on edX.
Each folder contains a game that can be run either by LÃ¶ve2D or Unity with the assigments proposed by the course.
Each of them obtained a passing grade and I was able to complete the course with them, including the final project, 
which you can also find in `equeipodlb-games50-projects-2018-x-final`
